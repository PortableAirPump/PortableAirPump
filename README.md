**What is a Portable Air Pump?**

A portable air pump is a compact, lightweight device designed to inflate tires, balls, pool floats, and other inflatables. These pumps are usually battery-operated, USB-rechargeable, or powered via a car‚Äôs cigarette lighter socket (12V DC). Unlike traditional manual pumps or large air compressors, portable air pumps are easy to carry, store, and use, making them ideal for both emergency and routine inflation needs.

**How Does a Portable Air Pump Work?**

Most portable air pumps use a miniature piston compressor system to compress and direct air into the object that needs inflating. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown:

1.	Power Source: The pump is powered by a rechargeable battery, a USB port, or a car socket.
2.	Motor Activation: When turned on, the motor drives a piston inside a cylinder.
3.	Air Compression: The movement of the piston compresses the air.
4.	Airflow Delivery: The compressed air is pushed through a hose into the item being inflated.
5.	Auto Shutoff (Optional): Many modern pumps feature a built-in pressure gauge and automatic shutoff once the desired PSI is reached.
